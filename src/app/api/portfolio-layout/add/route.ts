        // 2. Atomic Order Generation
        // We use findOneAndUpdate with upsert to guarantee a unique, sequential number.
        // We initialize with the current max order if the counter doesn't exist, to support migration?
        // Actually, if we are starting fresh or mixed, we should maybe sync first.
        // But for "Atomic Add", relying on a dedicated counter is safest.
        // If the counter drifts from actual boxes (e.g. manual delete), we might have gaps or collisions if we aren't careful?
        // Wait, if we use `order: unique` in schema, collisions fail.
        // If we delete box 5, next add should probably be 6 (gap fill? or append?)
        // The requirement says: "create new box with order + 1" (implies append).
        // "delete ONLY last box" implies we shrink from the end.
        // So `order` should roughly track `count`.
        // Let's use the counter approach as requested.

        // Ensure counter exists/synced? 
        // If we delete the last box, we should ideally decrement the counter? 
        // OR we just find max order from boxes + 1?
        // The "Counters collection" approach is standard for strict sequences.
        // But if we delete the last box, we must decrement the counter to reuse that order number?
        // Actually, simpler approach for "Add to End" + "Delete from End" is just:
        // Lock/Transaction -> Count/FindMax -> Insert Max+1.
        // But Mongo transactions are heavy/replica-set only?
        // The Counter pattern is robust. Let's use `LayoutCounter`.

        // However, if we delete the last box (say order 5), the counter is at 5.
        // Next add should return 5 again? No, it would return 6.
        // So we would have 1,2,3,4, [deleted 5], 6. -> GAP.
        // We want NO GAPS.
        // "order must be sequential", "no gaps allowed".

        // FIX: The `LayoutCounter` approach works well for "Invoice Numbers" that never decrease.
        // But for a "Layout Grid" where we want strict 1..N density, relying off `count` + atomic lock is better?
        // OR, when we "Delete Last", we explicitly Decrement the counter?

        // Let's stick to the requested "Atomic Counter" but ensure "Delete Last" handles the decrement.
        // AND handle the edge case where the counter might be desynced.

        /* 
           Simpler robust logic for "Append":
           1. Atomic FindAndModify on Counter to get next val?
           2. Create Box.
