## 4. Component Analysis

### Admin Components
- **`AdminLayout`**: Provides the sidebar navigation and layout structure for admin pages.
- **`Sidebar`**: Navigation menu for the admin dashboard.
- **`ProjectForm`**: A complex form handling project creation/editing with dynamic fields (tags, media, metrics) and validation.
- **`CategoryForm`**: Form for managing categories with hierarchy support.
- **`ImageUpload`**: Integrates Cloudinary widget for image uploads, extracting metadata (width, height, size).

### Portfolio Components
- **`PortfolioGrid`**: Displays a grid of project thumbnails with hover effects.
- **`CaseStudy`**: Renders the full details of a project, including gallery, process steps, and results.

### Shared Components
- **`ResponsiveImage`**: A wrapper around `next/image` to enforce consistent aspect ratios and lazy loading.

---

## 5. Portfolio System Analysis

The portfolio system is powered by the `Project` model and Server Actions.
- **Data Flow**: Admin creates/edits projects -> stored in MongoDB -> ISR revalidates `/portfolio` and `/portfolio/[slug]`.
- **Public View**: Users browse projects grid and view detailed case studies.
- **SEO**: Dynamic metadata generation based on project details.

---

## 6. Image Handling System

- **Storage**: Cloudinary is used for scalable image hosting.
- **Upload**: The `ImageUpload` component handles client-side upload via Cloudinary Widget.
- **Metadata**: Image URLs, dimensions, aspect ratios, and file sizes are stored in the database.
- **Display**: `ResponsiveImage` component uses the stored metadata to prevent layout shifts (CLS) and optimize loading.

---

## 7. Routing Structure

- **/admin**: Protected dashboard overview.
- **/admin/projects**: List of projects.
- **/admin/projects/create**: Create new project.
- **/admin/projects/edit/[id]**: Edit existing project.
- **/admin/categories**: List of categories.
- **/portfolio**: Public portfolio listing.
- **/portfolio/[slug]**: Public case study page.

---

## 8. Case Study System

Each project serves as a case study with structured data:
- **Overview, Problem, Objectives**: Text fields for storytelling.
- **Process Steps**: Array of steps describing the workflow.
- **Results/Metrics**: Quantifiable outcomes.
- **Gallery**: Collection of images showcasing the work.

---

## 9. UI / Design System

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for rapid development.
- **Dark Mode**: Supported via Tailwind's `dark:` classes (system preference or toggle).
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring usability on all devices.
